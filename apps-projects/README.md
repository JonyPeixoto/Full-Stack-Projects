This repository was created to put practical web 2.0 projects from the knowledge acquired from the main programming languages in the world, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP among other languages acquired in a self-taught way according to the official documentation of the languages whose focus is on <b>advanced projects</b>.

##  :information_source: Repositories

The purpose of this repository is to organize 3 categories into which my practical studies in programming were separated. Such as:

* <b><h3>Expo</h3></b>
   * Create amazing apps that run everywhere. Build one JavaScript/TypeScript project that runs natively on all your users' devices.
* <b><h3>Native Android(Kotlin)</h3></b>
   * Modern, concise and safe programming language. Easy to pick up, so you can create powerful applications immediately.
* <b><h3>PWA(Progressive Web App)</h3></b>
   * Progressive Web App (PWA) is a term used to denote a set of software development processes. Unlike the traditional ones. applications, a Progressive Web App can be seen as a hybrid evolution between web pages regular (or sites) and one mobile app. This new application model combines features offered by the most modern ones. browsers, with the advantages of using one cell phone.
